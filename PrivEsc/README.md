## Event Log Categories and Types

The main four log categories include application, security, setup, and system. Another type of category also exists called
forwarded events.


| Log Category      | Log Description                                                                                               |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| System Log        | The system log contains events related to the Windows system and its components. A system-level event could be a service failing at startup.                                   |
| Security Log      | Self-explanatory; these include security-related events such as failed and successful logins, and file creation/deletion. These can be used to detect various types of attacks that we will cover in later modules. |
| Application Log   | This stores events related to any software/application installed on the system. For example, if Slack has trouble starting, it will be recorded in this log.           |
| Setup Log         | This log holds any events that are generated when the Windows operating system is installed. In a domain environment, events related to Active Directory will be recorded in this log on domain controller hosts. |
| Forwarded Events | Logs that are forwarded from other hosts within the same network.                                                |





| Severity Level	|Level #	    |Description            |
|-------------------|---------------|---------------------
Verbose	|5	|Progress or success messages.
Information	|4	|An event that occurred on the system but did not cause any issues.
Warning	|3	|A potential problem that a sysadmin should dig into.
Error	|2	|An issue related to the system or service that does not require immediate attention.
Critical	|1	|This indicates a significant issue related to an application or a system that requires urgent attention by a sysadmin that, if not addressed, could lead to system or application instability.
