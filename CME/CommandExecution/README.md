HKLM\SOFTWARE\MICROSOFT\WINDOWS\CURRENTVERSION\POLICIES\SYSTEM: This is the registry key path where the new entry will be added. In this case, it's under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE (HKLM), in the SOFTWARE\MICROSOFT\WINDOWS\CURRENTVERSION\POLICIES\SYSTEM key.

/V LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy: This specifies the name of the registry entry to be created or modified. In this case, the entry is named LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy.

/t REG_DWORD: Specifies the type of the registry entry to be created. Here, it's a DWORD (double-word) value, which is a 32-bit integer.

/d 1: Specifies the data for the registry entry. In this case, the value is set to 1. This value is often used in the context of Remote UAC (User Account Control) to control how credentials are authenticated when connecting to remote systems.
