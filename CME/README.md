Exploiting Null/Anonymous Sessions

A Null Session is an anonymous connection to an inter-process communication network service on Windows-based computers. the service is designed to allow named pipe connections but may be used by attackers to gather information about the system remotely.

Domain users (--users)
Domain groups (--groups)
Password policy (--pass-pol)
Share folders (--shares)
